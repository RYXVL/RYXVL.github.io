                <p>Designed and developed a secure invoice management system based on a unified data model, ensuring strict separation of data across multiple companies. Implemented access control to prevent cross-company visibility of employees, customers, and invoices. Built using Python, the system allows employees to generate and retrieve invoices in PDF format, streamlining billing and transaction workflows.</p>
