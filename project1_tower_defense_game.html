                <p>A strategy-based tower defense game built using Pygame, where players place towers with unique health, damage, and range to defend against waves of enemies. The game uses Q-learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) algorithms to enable an AI agent to learn and optimize tower placement and decision-making strategies, adapting to different enemy types with their own health and damage attributes.</p>
